## Introduction
I recently wrapped up work on a text-based implementation of the board game Pandemic. The origin story of this project is back in 2018 during my early days of learning Python, I was curious about object-oriented programming. Games are a great fit for object-oriented patterns since they often have complex and interacting behaviors that are represented by literal objects. I had recently bought the game and was familiar with its rules, so I naturally chose it for this project. I ultimately managed to get a mostly working and mostly complete version up and running before running out of steam and taking a break.

I recently came across it again while re-organizing my coding projects and thought it was a shame I left it almost finished. I expected it would be only week or two in my spare time to tie up the remaining loose ends, but I ended up playing a good joke on myself because it ended up taking several. Some of this time was undoubtedly spent chasing perfection, but the main reason it took so long is it turns out game development (even for a simple text-based one) is very complex! I'm sure this is no surprise to anyone who's worked on similar projects, but it honestly caught me off guard. Unlike the data pipelines I usually work on that handle and transform data in a small number of rigid formats, this program had to harmonize many interlocking systems that may attempt to put the game into an invalid state during normal operation. It was a different style of programming than I'm used to, and since I learned a lot about creating robust and extensible programs, I wanted to briefly reflect on some lessons learned--both for myself and anyone else who might embark on a similar project in the future.

I've grouped my lessons into two broad categories. The first is a short but sweet plea for incorporating testing early and often in development, and the second is a series of observations about good practices for API design.

## Test early and often
The last thing I did was write a suite of tests for this project, but I really wish I had done it from the start. It would have saved me hours of manually playing the game attempting to debug complex game states that can only be reached after many turns. It also would have forced me to enforce modularity from the start. I was generally good about this, but there were a few parts of the codebase where I had to disentangle large multi-purpose functions into smaller components to test their functionalities individually. For example, during game setup I originally wrote a single function that both creates the game objects and puts them in their proper state for the start of a game. While convenient for firing up a game with a single function call, this design didn't provide access to a "clean slate" game state that would allow me precise control to test more complex scenarios.

To write my test suite, I used `pytest` which was easy to get started with but is also rich in features that support more complex tests. There are, however, [many other options](https://wiki.python.org/moin/PythonTestingToolsTaxonomy) in the Python ecosystem, including a testing module in the Python Standard Library called `unittest`. It supports a similar set of basic testing functionality, but `pytest` has more features. I've only used it briefly in the past, but I generally find the functional style of `pytest` cleaner and more intuitive over `pytest`'s more verbose object-oriented patterns. However, if "batteries-included" testing is a high priority, it's a good option.

## Good practices for API design
There's a common saying in computer science that there are only two hard problems: naming things and cache invalidation.[^1] At this point, it's thrown around so much and spawned so many variants that it feels trite to repeat it here, but I believe the first part at least holds a lot truth. (As a data scientist rather than a software engineer, I can't speak to the latter.) This shouldn't be too much of a surprise because the value of computer languages is in abstracting the details of the how the computer works, so the developer can focus on the solving the problem at hand. The right level of abstraction depends on the nature of the problem, but what all languages have in common is assigning meaningful names to operations. In assembly languages, these names correspond to the simple but fundamental operations of the processor, like moving a value into a registry, whereas in a high-level languages such as Python they correspond to intuitive but complex operations, like appending a value to a list. However, none of these languages would be of any value to humans if these operations didn't have names that reminded us what the computer is doing.

[^1]: This is commonly attributed to Phil Karlton, a software engineer at Netscape in the 90s.

This principle also applies when writing programs, and part of the art of software engineering is identifying the right abstractions for a particular problem and giving them meaningful names. This came into play with Pydemic when naming the classes that encapsulated the behavior and state of various game concepts, like cities and players. The names of these classes are generally intuitive, corresponding closely or even exactly with their natural language names. For example, the class that models cities is called `City`. Where this gets complicated, though, is instances of these classes are frequently represented by their natural language names, like `san_francisco` for the `City` representing it, both internally and externally. At first, I wasn't always consistent with using variable names that reflected these nuances. For example, I would sometimes use a variable called `city` to represent either the name of the `City` or the `City` itself rather than something more precise like `city_name`. While this might seem like splitting hairs, whether a variable is a string or a `City` was an essential piece of information when scanning a block of code and trying to quickly understand its function. I fixed these ambiguities where I found them, but the hard thing about these kinds of software engineering best practices is their adherence is entirely at the whim of the developer. A program will run even if all its variables have terrible names, but the project will suffer in the long run because those bad names become a barrier to entry as implementation details are forgotten or developers turn over. Ultimately, wrestling with code that I wrote years previously taught me that even a team of one is a collaboration, and coding standards are essential for facilitating that collaboration.

  - setters and getters
  - indicating success with return values and messages
  - explicit state
  - clarifying "internal" and "external" functions like actions
  - asking permission vs begging forgiveness
