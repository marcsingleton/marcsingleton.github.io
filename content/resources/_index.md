This is a page where I want to give shout outs to other great resources for all things coding, statistics, machine, learning, biology, etc. that I've come across on the web or elsewhere. I've at one point another found all of these useful for something I was trying to learn about, so I want to do my part to promote their hard work here (or at least boost their search results by feeding the ranking algorithms.)
