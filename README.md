This is the repo for my personal website, which I'm hosting using GitHub Pages. You can view the live site [here](https://marcsingleton.github.io/)! I'm developing it with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), and the design is based off the [Etch](https://themes.gohugo.io/themes/etch/) theme by Lukas Joswiak. It's simple but attractive and a great place to start for learning basic web development because it doesn't have any unnecessary bells and whistles which can be overwhelming when first starting out. I've modified it somewhat, though, both to make its structure more explicit as well as to tweak the appearance to my own taste. Feel free to use the theme as a template for your own projects!
