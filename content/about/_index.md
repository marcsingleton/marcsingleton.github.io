I'm a computational biologist who's currently a postdoc in the Eisen Lab at UC Berkeley where I also did my PhD in the Biophysics program. (I'm currently seeking new opportunities, so if I seem like a good fit for a role, don't hesitate to hit me up!) Before then, I did a brief stint at the NIH as a postbac where I worked in the NCATS DMPK Laboratory optimizing UPLC-MS/MS methods for candidate drug compounds. Though nowadays I'm more skilled with a keyboard than a pipette, I started my training at the bench as a chemistry major. In my first research experience, I was co-mentored by a stellar postdoc/grad student team split between a microbiology and mass spectrometry lab, respectively, which is how I landed a job doing bioanalytical chemistry right out of college. In the intervening years, I've steadily drifted towards the formal sciences. Fortunately, I also majored in applied math (another long story), so the transition was mostly a smooth one. I haven't forgotten my roots, however, and while I love a fancy machine learning model, I'm always an advocate of working with collaborators to design a better experiment over needlessly torturing a data set.

In my spare time, I enjoy spending time with my friends and partner exploring the broader Bay Area, whether that's trying new restaurants, seeing live music, exploring the great outdoors, or just plain hanging out. Some specific hobbies of mine are strength training, snowboarding, and hip-hop dancing, though I'm only proficient at one of them. I also bake on occasion and love a strong cup of coffee.
